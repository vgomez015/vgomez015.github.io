<p> My name is Vanessa Gomez.    I am a 17 year old girl.  
At the high school I go to, I have played volleyball and I have been on varsity for two years. 
I am a backrow passer. 
I also am involved in ASB.  That stands for Associated Student Body.  
This year I was elected as senior class President. 
Every Wednesday, we gather together to plan for upcoming events around school such as dances as well as rallies at school and fun events.  </p>

<p> In my house, I live with my father, mother, and little sister. I grew up on my Grandpa's strawberry farm in Watsonville, CA.  
We lived in a little house on top of a hill that overlooked the ranch.  It was here that my love for strawberries was born. </p>

<p> We have two dogs but the newest addition to our family is a German Shephard mixed with an Australian Shephard.  His name is Prince. </p>

<p> This summer I also had the great opportunity to visit Poland for World Youth Day.  
This was a great way to get to know many other fellow Catholics as well as visit a new and exciting country.  
For two whole weeks we stayed with 2 different host families in different cities.  Our first home was in Lublin.  
Our host family, a mom and dad, lived in apartments that are called flats.
However, the morning we got there, one of her daughters came to visit with her husband and three children.  The oldest was around my age and he spoke English.  
He made it very east to talk to our host families. </p>
<p> It was a somewhat similar story in the next town we stayed in.  
Our host family consisted of a mom, dad, and daughter that lived in a 2 story house next to a large house in a little town close to Krakow. 
The daughter was around my parents age and she was able to translate for all of us to talk to one another.  </p>

Poland is a beautiful green country full of so much history. Throught our stay, I learned so much interesting and amazing history that the Polish had gone through throughout the years.  
It was amazing being able to visit and experience a totally different culture to the one I know. </p>
